# NLP/NLU Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks to illustrate the important concepts in the feilds of Natural Langauge Processing and Natural Language Understanding.

---
Computers using natural language as input and/or output. The science of learning from text data and extraction of meaning is called Natural Language Processing(NLP), Natural Language Understanding(NLU) takes a slight deviation from processing but is related to NLP.
Some implementations of NLP we see in our day to day life are:
1. Identification of different cohorts of users/customers based on their product reviews by doing sentiment analysis by predicting the churn, preferences of individual customers.
2. Sentiment Analysis will also accurately detect and extract different categories of feedback(identifying the positive and negative reviews/opinions, mentions of particular attributes such as shoe size/fit )
3. Classifying text according to intent (if a problem requires immediate attention or is it more like a regular product support)

There are many other applications to the NLP/NLU and is an active research area. Topic of intrest for many and applied to many feilds for numerous applications.

These notebooks not only targets the audience who cna refer to the exercises to learn about concepts but also to anyone who wants to build a real-world nlp solution. Real-World data is far from the academic reseacrh and mostly availble in raw form, we start at that point and will build solutions to many complex solutions.

These notebooks prepare induviduals to Gather, prepare and ingesting real-time data. We start with building simple models to start and we will eventually explore deep learning technologies which performs effectively on nosiy and learns features on the fly. With these notebooks users will be able to intrepret and understand the structure of models. We also try to demonstrate how some frameworks perform better than others.

For any NLP problem the approach has to be effecitve but have to be from simple easy to ingest models.

1. We will start with building notebooks that are quick and simple.
2. Explain it's predictions.
3. Understand what is the tradeoff with the model you choose and se if you can improve the performance, if so do it!
4. The knowledge you acquired at the previous step is actually helpful to judge the performance of the model on the slected     data or the complex model.

 For real time processing you can look into clousd services such as AWS,GCP, Spark, Kafka but if the setup is local

  ### Datasets
  In the respective notebooks, we included where and how to munge the data, please create the folders and split the data accordingly as mentioned in the notebooks. Please make sure the path to the data folder is mentioned accurately.
  1. GloVe word embeddings http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip, download the data and extract the      text file into a folder with a file path data/glove/name_of_txt_file.
  2. Yelp 
     Sign-up at the following location to download the dataset.For the scope of these notebooks we only       need the review dataset.
  3. AG news dataset consists of news articles with 4 largest classes. 30K training samples, 1900            examples for each class for testing.
