It's based on the precision you hit with n-grams in your prediction compared to your target. Let's see this on an example. Imagine you have the target sentence\n","```\n","The cat is walking in the garden\n","```\n","And your model gives you the following output\n","```\n","The cat is running in the fields\n","```\n","We are going to compute the precision, which is the number of correctly predicted n-grams divided by the number of predicted n-grams for n going from 1 to 4.\n","\n","For 1-grams (or tokens, more simply), we have predicted 5 correct words out of 7, so we get a precision of 5/7. Note that the order doesn't matter, for instance predicting\n","```\n","She read the book because she was interested in world history\n","```\n","Instead of\n","```\n","She was interested in world history because she read the book\n","```\n","would give a precision of 1 for the 1-grams.\n","\n","For 2-grams, in the first example, we have 3 correct 2-grams (\"the cat\", \"cat is\" and \"in the\") out of 6, so a precision of 3/6. In the second example, the precision for 2-grams is 9/10.\n","\n","For 3-grams, in the first example, we have only 1 correct 3-gram (\"the cat is\") out of 5, so a precision of 1/5. In the second example, the precision for 3-grams is 6/9.\n","\n","For 4-grams, in the first example, we don't have any 4-gram that is correct, so the precision is 0. In the second example, it's 4/8.\n","\n","There is one big drawback in just taking the raw precision: very often a seq2seq model will predict the Same easy word. If take the prediction\n","```\n","The the the the the the the the\n","```\n","for our first example, it would score a precision of 1. for 1-grams (because `the` is in the target sentence, so all the words are considered correct). To avoid that, we put a maximum for a given words to the number of times it can be considered correct, which is the number of times that word is in the target sentence. So in our example, only 2 of the 7 the are considered correct and this clamped precision gives us 2/7 for 1-grams.\n","\n","One thing to note is that when we deal with a whole corpus, we take the sum of all the corrects over all the sentences then divide by the sum of all the predicted over all the sentences (we don't avarage precisions over each sentence).\n","\n","To compute the BLEU score, the final formula is then\n","```\n","BLEU = length_penalty * ((p1 * p2 * p3 * p4) ** 0.25)\n","```\n","which is the geometric average of `p1`, `p2`, `p3` and `p4` (our n-gram precision scores) multiplied by a penalty given for the length: we penalize longer predictions with the precision scores, but short ones get it easier, especially if they only contain correct words. So we apply the following penalty:\n","```\n","length_penalty = 1 if len(pred) >= len(targ) else (1 - exp(len(targ)/len(pred)))\n","```\n","\n","And if we are taking the BLEU score of a whole corpus, we use the sum of the lengths of predicted sentences and the sum of the lengths of predicted targets."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ekqPqUrHtw9P","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Let's code this"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dYWJoxqvtw9R","colab_type":"text"},"source":["There is an implementation of BLEU in nltk, but the problem is that it's designed to support lists of tokenized texts, and therefore is very slow (5 hours announced on the validation set of the translation notebook for the average of BLEU scores of sentences).
